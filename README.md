# GamerGrep

üèÜ **Your games. Your stats.** üèÜ

# Getting Started

Style guide: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript  
Tailwindcss docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs  
Jest docs: https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react  
Cypress docs: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions  
StorybookJS docs: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction

## Running locally

Make sure you globally install Commitizen with `npm i commitizen -g`. This will allow you to push clean, useful, standardized commits. ‚ù§Ô∏è

**To design & test individual components, first use Storybook:**

```
yarn storybook
```

**When you're ready to integrate components, continue.**  
Start the Webpack server and live reloads with:

```
yarn start
```

## Test your code

Run unit tests with:

```
yarn test
```

With the app running, run e2e Cypress tests with:

```
yarn e2e
```

## Commit your code

Commit using:

```
yarn commit
```

Commitizen will walk you through the required fields.  
The main style points are

- Use imperative, present tense, "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't put a dot (.) at the end
- Breaking changes should start with `BREAKING CHANGE:`

This is not enforced and commits can pass through without using this. But that's nasty.

## Package the app

To package the app in a distributable format (dmg, Windows installer), run

```
yarn dist
```
